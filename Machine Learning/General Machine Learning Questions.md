# 1. General Concepts
## Bias & Variance
- **Bias**: the difference between the average prediction result of the model & the actual value.
- **Variance**: the variability of model prediction.
- **Occurance Situation**: Bias occurs when the model is too simple and can not capture the complexity of the data. A model with high bias will tend to underfit the data, and have poor performance in both the training & testing data; Variance occurs when the model is too complex and can even capture the noise of the data. A model with high variance will tend to overfit the data, and have high performance on training data, poor performance on testing data.
- **Bias & Variance tradeoff**:
